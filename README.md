# Convolutional Neural Network
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks commonly used for analyzing visual data. They have achieved state-of-the-art results in various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive overview of CNNs:

Key Components of CNNs
Input Layer:

The input layer takes in the raw pixel values of an image. For example, a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels would have an input shape of (28, 28, 1), where the last dimension represents the single color channel.
Convolutional Layer:

This is the core building block of a CNN. It applies convolution operations to the input using learnable filters (kernels). Each filter slides over the input image, capturing features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
Kernel: A small matrix (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) used to convolve the input.
Filter: A set of multiple kernels applied to the input to extract different features.
Activation Layer (ReLU):

After the convolution operation, an activation function like Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity into the model. ReLU outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.
Pooling Layer:

Pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making the computation more efficient and reducing the risk of overfitting. The most common types are MaxPooling (selects the maximum value) and AveragePooling (computes the average value).
Fully Connected (Dense) Layer:

These layers are typically used towards the end of the network. They connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer and are responsible for making the final predictions.
Dropout Layer:

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. During training, random neurons are "dropped out," meaning they are ignored, which forces the network to learn more robust and generalized features.
Batch Normalization Layer:

This layer normalizes the inputs of a layer by adjusting and scaling them. It helps stabilize and accelerate the training process by reducing internal covariate shift.
Flatten Layer:

Converts multi-dimensional feature maps into a one-dimensional vector, preparing the data for input into fully connected layers.
Upsampling Layer:

Used to increase the spatial resolution of feature maps, commonly employed in tasks like image segmentation. Techniques include Nearest Neighbors upsampling and Transposed Convolution (deconvolution).
Important Concepts
Padding:

Valid Padding: No padding is added; the output feature map is smaller than the input.
Same Padding: Zero-padding is added to ensure the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions as the input.
Stride:

The step size at which the filter moves across the input. A larger stride reduces the spatial dimensions of the output feature map.
